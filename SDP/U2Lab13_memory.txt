# Memory (Group)

### Task

Create a memory matching game - this is a group project

---

### Requirements

- Every Project:
    - Push completed work to a new GitHub repo - name appropriately
    - Use proper filesystem organization
    - Include all required elements in index.html
    - Include a proper heading
    - Give your page an appropriate title (title tag)
- Your game should include at least 20 “cards” and work for TWO players.  Each time the game is played, the positions of the images should be randomized.
- When a “card” is clicked, it should reveal an image.  Players should click TWO cards - if they match they win a point and get a second turn in a row.
- Matched “cards” can either remain face up (and not clickable) or can be removed from play.  The game ends when there are no more matches to be made. Include a “play again button” and use session storage to track how many game wins each player has.
- Create a main game page (where you play) and a rules page (where the instructions and all card matches are visible)
- Create a header/menu bar that will be at the top of EVERY PAGE (including the SDP).  The header should include the game name and links to your home (game), rules, and SDP pages.
- Your website should be professional and fit one of these themes:
    - Fall
    - Thanksgiving
    - Halloween
    - Autumn Forest
    - Harvest

### Professional Website Requirements

- **Color**
    - Color choices are used carefully to highlight important information.
    - If multiple colors are used, these colors are chosen with care so that the resulting visuals are clear and all elements are readable and are easy to look at.
    - Avoid using exclusively bright colors.  Not all page elements need to be something other than black or white.
- **Text & Font**
    - Written information is clear and grammatically correct
    - Font choice prioritizes readability
    - Font sizes and colors are appropriate and make the content easy to read
    - Important information is easily identified using text modifications (bold, italics, color change, etc)
- **Images & Resources**
    - Additional page elements (like images) add value to the page and are chosen thoughtfully
    - Images have a clear purpose and are positioned on the page in a meaningful way
    - Images have a proper alt text value
    - Images are properly stored and organized by page in the “resources” folder in the file tree
- **Links**
    - Clickable items (text links or images) are clearly identified
    - External resources are chosen thoughtfully and make sense in the context of the page
    - Internal page links allow the user to navigate throughout your website. Each internal page is organized in the “pages” folder in the file tree.
- **Inspect**
    - The console should not show any text or testing outputs. Users can have access to this information and it is not safe or professional for them to see it.

### SDP

Create a new file called “U2_Lab13_SDP.html”. Store this HTML page in the “pages” folder, in a folder named “SDP”.  Include a link to your SDP page somewhere in index.html.  Record your responses to the following questions.  Answer each question thoroughly and with full and complete sentences. Please make sure that all questions appear on different lines on the web page.

1. Review the criteria listed above.  Divide up the work. List what general tasks/requirements each partner will be responsible for.
2. What will be the theme of your website? (choose from the listed options)
3. What challenges do you foresee while working on this project? (Either code wise or group project wise)
